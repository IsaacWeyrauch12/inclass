                <span class="highligted">Development:</span> The Nevera was initially revealed as the C_Two concept car. Since 2018, Rimac spent over three years refining the car as part of an extensive test and development programme. Almost all key components of the Nevera are designed and manufactured at Rimac's headquarters near Zagreb, Croatia.[13]

                During the global homologation process, the company constructed 4 prototypes for different testing purposes.[1]
                
                In June 2020, Rimac opened a new facility in Veliko Trgovišće which will serve as the assembly for Nevera homologation prototypes as well as future production vehicles for customers. At full capacity, the facility should produce 4 vehicles per month and currently plans to produce an additional 13 prototype vehicles by the end of 2020. The delivery of production cars to customers was initially planned in 2020 but was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[1]
                
                In February 2022, the crash test program for the global homologation of the Nevera was completed after four years. The final test was for the US – European crash testing had already been completed in 2021.
